/*
Operator in java is a symbol that is used to perform operations.
There are many types of operators in Java
1.Unary Operator:-
The java unary operators require only one operand. Unary operators are used for
->incrementing/decrementing a value by one (++, --, )
->negating an expression(!)
->inverting the value of a boolean(~)

2.Arithmetic Operators:-
The arithmetic operators are used to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
(+, -, *, /)

3.Bit-shift Operators:-
In java bit-shift operators are used to shift bits of an operand to left or right.
Left shift operator <<
Right shift operator >>
>>>, >> works same for positive number, but for negative number >>> changes parity bit (MSB) to 0.

4.Relational Operators:-
Relational operators are comparison and equality operators.
<, >, <=, >=, instanceof are comparison operators.
==, != are equality operators.

5.Bitwise and Logical Operators:-
The logical operators evaluate an expression to true or false.
&&, & are AND operator.
||, | are OR operator.
The logical &&, || operators don't check the second condition if the first condition is false.
It checks the second condition only if the first one is true.

The bitwise &, | operator checks both conditions whether first condition is true or false.
^ is bitwise XOR

6.Ternary Operators:-
Ternary operator is one line replacement for if-the-else.
(condition)?(statement1):(statement2)

7.Assignment Operators:-
Assignment operator is used to assign the value on its right to the operand on its left.
(=)
